# magic-cli
**A foundation for building your own suite of command line tools.**

magic-cli exists to make it easy to create a set of tools that work together.  It's not a tool you use as-is; it's here to offer a starting point for your own custom command line tools.

Learn more about the origins of magic-cli in [The Joy of Internal Tools](https://medium.com/@SlackEng/4a1bb5fe905b), a post on the Slack Engineering blog.

## Customization
Rename the `magic-cli` script to whatever you want â€” for example, if you happen to work for example.com, you might rename it to `example`.

Now, when you run `example`, it will look for executables in the same directory as itself which have filenames that begin with `example-`. If there's an executable called `example-build`, you could run it by typing `example build`.

Now, when you type `example`, you'll see `example build` in the list of supported subcommands. For extra credit, you can add a human-readable description in that list by putting a comment immediately under the `#!` line:

````bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# This line will be shown in the list of commands.
````

## Installation
This repository includes a Makefile that will install `magic-cli` and all of its subcommands into `/usr/local/bin`:

````bash
$ make install
````

You can also use it to uninstall `magic-cli`:

````bash
$ make uninstall
````

If you rename magic-cli to something different, change the value of `PREFIX` in the Makefile.
